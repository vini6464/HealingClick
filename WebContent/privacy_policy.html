</li>

under the SPI Rules requires your express consent. By affirming your assent to this Privacy
Policy, you provide your consent to such collection as required under applicable law. Our Services
may be unavailable to you in the event such consent through an email is not given.
</li><li> Healing Click does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any

marketing-related information regarding the Services, please send us an email at
